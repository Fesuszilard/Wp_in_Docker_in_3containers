# Wp_in_Docker_in_3containers
Wp instalation in three containers:
1th container include the the msql database
2nd and 3rd container include seperate wp instance.
In the 4th container contain the wp cli, where the admin name and password set up
In the .env file contain the variable to set up the configuration
In that case the container run in one server but if we change the configuration we can run at seperated servers.
